25	In bulk vessels water travels by xylem flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of substance organic inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water source into cells and phloem sap moves from flows of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources called sinks, is to pressure flow. At the sources are the leaves), sugar molecules (usually moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
