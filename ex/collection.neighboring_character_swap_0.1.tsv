12	Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Jutsice. Restorative justiec is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all staekholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecitng restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and atking steps to repair hamr, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities nad their governments in responding to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair teh harm to victims and community members. Faciliatte the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probaiton staff.
14	The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restortaive justice, and hten to review hte rgowing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crim;e the community of care; and civil soceityâmay be injured by crmie in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The senes of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order wtihin the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind fo crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	The approach si based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offesne against an individual or community, rather htan the State. Restorative justice that fostesr dialogue between victim and offender has sohwn teh highest rates of victim satisfactoin and offender accountability.

Criminal justice, however, is nto usually cocneptualised as a disptue between victim and offender, ubt is insetad seen as a matter concerning the relationshpi between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.

23	hPloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis s(ucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primraily of dead eclls), the phloem si composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based sloution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessels watre travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In pholem, concentration of organic sbustance inside a phlome cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by whihc water flows into cells and phloem asp moves from source of organic susbtance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinsk, si callde pressure flow. tA the sources u(sually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucorse and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the lpant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals rfom the roots is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrietns from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage orgasn like orots, tubers or bulbs.
29	At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-tresaurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a reslut many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, aCrlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders fo the organization.

34	The rsie of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Fwe Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of Ameircan industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but ont completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspenedd the immigartion of hCinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
36	Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed hte policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidairty in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
37	The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced ni the United Staets before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
38	This finally resultde in legislation that aimed to limit future immigartion of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the Untied States and China.

52	But the basic details of your urine -- color, smell, and how often you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made fo water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys make it when they filter toixns and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood si present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of hte urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine thta may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination sectoin).
54	The shade, light ro dark, also changes. If it has no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug aclled a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very dark honey- or brown-colored urnie could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids rigth away.

69	Howeve,r a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EALRY SA POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud records teh leaders of the Sanhedrin cocasionally doing ...
70	Some people clami that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the decidnig factor as ot when to start the new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	Barley (Horedum vulgare L.), a member fo the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It was one of the first cutlivated grains and is now grown widely. Barley rgain is a staple in iTbetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants ni Mdeieval Europe. Barley has also been used as anmial fdoder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foosd.
72	The state of the balrey harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of a year ot be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of the barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER ENW MOON SHOULD BE USED OT START TEH YEAR!
73	The grape harvest wsa suually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive ahrvest came after the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three mjaor crops: the spring grain harves,t the summer grape harvest and the uatumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is ont as ocld tloerant as the winetr wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter tritciale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a witner crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	âWheat ripens later thna barley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, erproduced below).
76	That claim is obviously ont correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop, even if on occasions in the firts and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the abrley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown in the autmun, after the early rains, and the barley harvest, which fro nay given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho in April--or even March--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or beginning fo Jun.e
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvesât (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted ni the autumn and ripened in spring. Barely matuerd fatser and would be havrested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during teh Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
79	There are ohwever some very serious illnesses that can cause this pain in left side under ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection of the abdominal aorta. It could aslo be a spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericadrritis (inflammation of teh heart sac).
80	Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection of the abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying frmo an internal hemorrhage si the major riks involved in this situation.
81	What organs are on yuor left sdie fo body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just osme of the possible reasons why you may eb feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas Stuck ni hte Colon â There is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colo.n The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
82	For the indivdiual bnoes, see Rib. For risb of animals as food, see Ribs f(ood). For other uses, see iRb (disambiguation). The rib cage si an arrangement of bones ni teh thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is ofrmed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and enclsoes the heart and lungs.
83	If the lower set of ribs on the right sied of the rib cage get daamged due ot an injury, thne one is likely to experinece a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pian worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to teh ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart adn lungs are protected by hte rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestvie system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
85	The only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one of hte lugns is under the left rbi cage, and then the heart is also foudn here. The oâ¦nly other part of the hcest cvaity to be onted would be teh diaphragm, which aids a perso'ns breathing. 4 people ofund this useful.
86	Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper portion of hte left side fo yuor abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage. Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen has already ruptured because of various reasons and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft, and they are numbered from top to bottmo. Teh head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it articulates. It is marekd by a kidney-shaped articular surface whcih is divided by a horiozntal crest into two facets.
88	With either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caguht in the colon. This is even less seriosu taht acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sahrp pain left side under irbs migth come from a ocndition called costohcondritis.
