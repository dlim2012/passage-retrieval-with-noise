7	 Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking duringWorld War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It wasled bythe United States with the support ofthe United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was underthe direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

12	 Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminalbehaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practicesand programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repairharm, 2  involving allstakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governmentsinresponding to crime.
13	 Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committeesthat meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offenderobligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the processof apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
14	 The purpose of this paper is to pointout a numberof unresolved issues inthe criminal justice system, presentthe underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	 Each ofthese typesof communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; thecommunity of care; and civil societyâmay be injured bycrime in different ways anddegrees, but all will be affected in commonways as well: The sense of safety and confidence oftheir members is threatened, order withinthe community is threatened, and (depending on the kindofcrime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	 The approach isbased ona theory of justice thatconsiders crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community,rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialoguebetween victim and offender has shown the highest rates ofvictim satisfaction and offender accountability.
17	 Inherent in many peopleâs understanding of the notion of ADR is theexistence of adispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victimand offender, butis instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complexquestion as to whether a criminal offence canproperly be described as a âdisputeâ.

19	 The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim butalso friends and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencingand circlesis that circlesdo not focus exclusively onthe offense and do not limit theirsolutions to repairing the harm between the victimand the offender.
20	 Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose andglucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
21	 Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportationof food and water in aplant. They are the vascular tissues of theplant andtogether form vascular bundles.They work togetheras a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water.

23	 Phloemis a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloemcarries theproducts of photosynthesis(sucrose and glucose) from theleaves to other parts of the plant.
24	 Unlike xylem (which is composedprimarily of dead cells),the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	 In xylem vessels water travels bybulk flow rather than cell diffusion. Inphloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloemcell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cells and phloemsap moves from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	 The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is calledpressure flow. At the sources (usually theleaves), sugar moleculesare moved into the sieve elements(phloem cells) through active transport.
27	 Phloem carries the products ofphotosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the rootsis called the xylem.
28	 Xylem transports water andsoluble mineralnutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plantstostorage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.
29	 At this time the Industrial Workers ofthe World had a membership ofover 100,000 members.In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer ofthe Industrial Workers of theWorld. By thistime, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	 Thiswas not true of the Industrial Workers of the Worldand as a result many of its memberswere first and second generation immigrants.Severalimmigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, CarloTresca,Arturo Giovannitti andJoe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
31	 Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
32	 The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitledtheir co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the latenineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
33	 Americanobjections to Chinese immigration took manyforms, and generally stemmedfrom economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so inorder to send money back to China to support their families there.
34	 The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at theend of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
35	 The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States torestrict, butnot completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigrationof Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for aperiod of 10 years.
36	 Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposedthe policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labourorganisation, the Industrial Workers of theWorld (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
37	 The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed themajority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90percent of the steel production inthe United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
38	 This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the UnitedStates,and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

49	 Colorâurinecan bea variety of colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very darkor amber. Unusual orabnormal urine colors canbe the result of a disease process, several medications (e.g.,multivitamins can turn urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.

51	 During the visual examination of the urine, the laboratorian observes the urine's color and clarity. These can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine. They are interpreted in conjunction with results obtained during the chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm what substances are present.
52	 But the basic details of your urine-- color, smell, and howoften you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made of water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys make it when they filter toxins and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	 However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease ordamage to some part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine that may be a signof bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
54	 The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it has no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very darkhoney- or brown-coloredurine could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids right away.
55	 Agood rule of thumb is thedarkeryour urine, themore water you need todrink. And if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow (which weâll get into down below) something may be wrong.

69	 However, a major motive withpeople today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start ofthe year is tojustifystarting the year ASEARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the oppositeofwhat the Talmud records the leaders of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
70	 Some people claim that the timingofthe barleyharvest in Israel should be thedeciding factor as to whento start the new year fordetermining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	 Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It was one of the first cultivated grains and isnowgrownwidely.Barley grain is a staple in Tibetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants in MedievalEurope. Barley has also been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer andcertain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
72	 The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of ayear to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON(thereby giving the previous year a 13th month),butthe state of thebarley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USEDTO START THE YEAR!
73	 The grape harvest was usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came afterthe autumn festivals. In ancient Israelthe primaryharvest season extended from April to November. This harvest periodmight be subdividedinto threeseasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvestand the autumn olive harvest.
74	 Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A.Camus.), but may besown as a winter crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has ashort growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	 âWheat ripenslater thanbarley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to endof May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
76	 That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop,even if on occasions in the first and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use thestate of the barleyharvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	 Barley is always sownin the autumn,afterthe early rains, and the barley harvest, which for any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho inApril--orevenMarch--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until theendof May orbeginning of June.
78	 Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecostwasalso calledâthe Feastof Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat wereplanted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured fasterand would beharvested sooner.The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread wouldhave been barley.
79	 There are however some very serious illnesses that cancause this pain in leftside underribs. Thesewould include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection ofthe abdominal aorta. It could alsobea spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericardritis (inflammation of the heart sac).
80	 Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreasand canbe caused byeating very fattyfoods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection ofthe abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying from an internal hemorrhage is the major risk involved in this situation.
81	 Whatorgans are on your left side of body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feelingpainunder your left rib cage: Gas Stuck in the Colon â Thereis a chance that youhave gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
82	 For the individual bones, see Rib. For ribs of animals asfood, see Ribs (food). For other uses, seeRib(disambiguation). The rib cage is an arrangement of bonesin the thorax of all vertebrates exceptthe lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and enclosesthe heart and lungs.
83	 If the lower set of ribs on theright side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury, then one is likelyto experience asharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestive system.These includetheliver, gallbladder, kidneys,pancreas,spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
85	 The only organs contained in the chest cavity arethelungs and the heart. Obviously, one ofthe lungs is under the left rib cage, and thenthe heart is alsofound here. The oâ¦nly other part of the chest cavity to be noted would bethe diaphragm, which aidsa person's breathing.4 people found this useful.
86	 Usually, you can feel the painreverberating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage.Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen hasalreadyruptured because of various reasonsand this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists ofahead, neck, and a shaft,and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head ofrib is the end partclosest to the spine with which it articulates.It is marked bya kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontalcrestinto two facets.
88	With either of these there isa fairly simple medication treatment.There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. Thisis even less serious that acidreflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.
