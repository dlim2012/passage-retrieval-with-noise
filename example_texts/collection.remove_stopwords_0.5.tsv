23	Phloem is conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products photosynthesis (sucrose glucose) leaves parts the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is water-based solution, rich sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessels water travels bulk flow rather cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates diffusion gradient by water flows cells and phloem sap moves source organic substance sugar sinks turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism which sugars transported through phloem, sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carries the products photosynthesis (sucrose glucose) from leaves to parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals the roots is called xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients roots various parts of plant. It responsible replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made photosynthetic areas plants to storage organs like roots, tubers bulbs.
