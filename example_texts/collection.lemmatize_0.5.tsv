12	Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and program reflecting restorative purpose will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking step to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committee that meet with the offender to discus the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apology to victim and communities. Invite local victim advocate to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
14	The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issue in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principle of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil societyâmay be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common value of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that foster dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
17	Inherent in many peopleâs understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen a a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raise a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described a a âdisputeâ.

19	The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim but also friend and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencing and circle is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the offender.
20	Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carry the product of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaf to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
21	Phloem and xylem are complex tissue that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together a a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, mineral and water.

23	Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the product of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cell that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugar made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessel water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cell and phloem sap move from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the source (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve element (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carry the product of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the root is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transport water and soluble mineral nutrient from roots to various part of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic area of plants to storage organ like roots, tuber or bulbs.
29	At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John a secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of it members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrant such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
31	Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese worker migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
32	The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
33	American objection to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, a well a ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their family there.
34	The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of city represented perhaps the greatest change of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborer (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
36	Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 group who opposed the policy of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal wa to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
37	The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late a 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
38	This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relation between the United States and China.

49	Colorâurine can be a variety of colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very dark or amber. Unusual or abnormal urine color can be the result of a disease process, several medications (e.g., multivitamin can turn urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.
50	I had 3 cup of coffee and a red bull today all in 4 hours. The first time I urinated, it wa an amber color. Then I got worried and drank a lot of water and now my urine is back to normal (light yellow). This only happened once after drinking all that caffeine. Related Topics: Coffee, Urination, Drinking, Caffeine.
51	During the visual examination of the urine, the laboratorian observes the urine's color and clarity. These can be sign of what substance may be present in the urine. They are interpreted in conjunction with result obtained during the chemical and microscopic examination to confirm what substance are present.
52	But the basic details of your urine -- color, smell, and how often you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made of water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidney make it when they filter toxin and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine that may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
54	The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it ha no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very dark honey- or brown-colored urine could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids right away.
55	A good rule of thumb is the darker your urine, the more water you need to drink. And if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow (which weâll get into down below) something may be wrong.
56	Color, density, and smell can reveal health problems. Human urine has been a useful tool of diagnosis since the earliest days of medicine. The color, density, and smell of urine can reveal much about the state of our health. Here, for starters, are some of the things you can tell from the hue of your liquid excreta. Advertising Policy.
57	More concentrated urine in the bladder can be darker. As long as your urine returned to a more-normal, light yellow color after you drank more water, there is no need to be concerned.

This interaction again demonstrates crosstalk between autoimmune disturbance in the thyroid system and the liver.
62	Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a chronic, or long-term, disease of the liver that slowly destroys the medium-sized bile duct within the liver. Bile is a digestive liquid that is made in the liver.

69	However, a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud record the leader of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
70	Some people claim that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It wa one of the first cultivated grain and is now grown widely. Barley grain is a staple in Tibetan cuisine and wa eaten widely by peasants in Medieval Europe. Barley has also been used a animal fodder, a a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and a a component of various health foods.
72	The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of a year to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of the barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
73	The grape harvest wa usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came after the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is not as cold tolerant a the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown a a winter crop in warmer area of Australia and Great Britain. Barley ha a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	âWheat ripens later than barley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
76	That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop, even if on occasion in the first and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leader of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown in the autumn, after the early rains, and the barley harvest, which for any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begin near Jericho in April--or even March--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or beginning of June.
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offering (verses 16-17). Pentecost wa also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
79	There are however some very serious illness that can cause this pain in left side under ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection of the abdominal aorta. It could also be a spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericardritis (inflammation of the heart sac).
80	Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection of the abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying from an internal hemorrhage is the major risk involved in this situation.
81	What organ are on your left side of body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas Stuck in the Colon â There is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
82	For the individual bones, see Rib. For ribs of animals a food, see Ribs (food). For other uses, see Rib (disambiguation). The rib cage is an arrangement of bone in the thorax of all vertebrate except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs.
83	If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury, then one is likely to experience a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart and lung are protected by the rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organ that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestive system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
85	The only organ contained in the chest cavity are the lung and the heart. Obviously, one of the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart is also found here. The oâ¦nly other part of the chest cavity to be noted would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this useful.
86	Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage. Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen ha already ruptured because of various reason and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft, and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two facets.
88	With either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. This is even le serious that acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.
