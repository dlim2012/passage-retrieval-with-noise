12	Tutorial: Introduction Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This lead to transformation people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond crime by: 1  identifying taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees meet with offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates provide ongoing victim-awareness training probation staff.
14	The purpose of this paper is to point number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
15	Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community victim, offender, or crime; the community care; and civil societyâmay be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged perhaps eroded.
16	The approach is based theory justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against individual community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction offender accountability.
17	Inherent many peopleâs understanding the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.

23	Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose glucose) from the leaves other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily dead cells), phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
25	In xylem vessels water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows cells and phloem sap moves source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
27	Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from roots is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.
29	At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer the Industrial Workers the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.

34	The rise of industrial America, the dominance wage labor, and growth cities represented perhaps the greatest changes the period. Few Americans the end the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise American industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for period of 10 years.
36	Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives 43 groups who opposed policies of American Federation of Labour, formed radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle overthrow the employing class.
37	The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed majority iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production the United States. They the nationâs largest consumer of lumber a major consumer coal.
38	This finally resulted in legislation that aimed limit future immigration Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

69	However, a major motive with people today wanting to use barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud records the leaders of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
70	Some people claim that the timing the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when start new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
71	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), member of grass family, is a major cereal grain. It one of the first cultivated grains and now grown widely. Barley grain is staple in Tibetan cuisine was eaten widely by peasants Medieval Europe. Barley has also used as animal fodder, source of fermentable material beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
72	The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause start of a year to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
73	The grape harvest was usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown a winter crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has short growing season is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	âWheat ripens later than barley and, according the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
76	That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of barley crop, even if on occasions in the first and second centuries A.D. pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown the autumn, early rains, and barley harvest, which any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho April--or even March--but in hill country Palestine not concluded until the end of May or beginning of June.
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival Unleavened Bread would have barley.

83	If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to injury, then one is likely to experience sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend twist the body, then an X-ray examination should conducted study the extent of damage to ribs.
84	Vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Under rib cage lie many organs that form part of abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in abdominal region are a part of the digestive system. These include liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and large intestine.
85	The only organs contained in the chest cavity the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart also found here. The oâ¦nly other part of chest cavity to be noted would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this useful.

88	With either of these there a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. This is even less serious that acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.
