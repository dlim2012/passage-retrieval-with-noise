0	The presence of communication among the scientific minds was just as important to the success of the Manhattan Project as was the scientific intellect. The only cloud hanging over the impressive achievements of atomic researchers and engineers is what their success really meant; hundreds of thousands of innocent lives destroyed.
1	The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped end World War II. His legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to impact history and science.
2	Manhattan Project Essay - The Manhattan Project The Manhattan Project aimed to determine if building an atomic bomb was possible. The success of this project would forever change the world by making it known that something so powerful can be created by man.
3	The Manhattan Project was the name of a project carried out during World War II, to develop the first atomic bomb. It refers specifically to the period of the project from 194…2 to 1946 under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the administration of General Leslie R. Groves.

5	The Manhattan Project. This formerly classified photograph features the first atomic bomb, a weapon that atomic scientists dubbed the Gadget. The nuclear age began on July 16, 1945, when it exploded in the New Mexico desert.
6	Nor will it attempt to substitute for the extraordinarily rich literature on the atomic bombs and the end of World War II. This collection does not attempt to document the origins and development of the Manhattan Project.
7	Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development enterprise during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with support from the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The armed component of the project has been designated
8	In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers launched the Manhattan Project - The Secret Name of the 2 Atomic Bombs.
9	One of the main reasons Hanford was chosen as the site for the Manhattan Project's B reactor was its proximity to the Columbia River, the largest river flowing into the Pacific Ocean from the North American coast.

11	punishment designed to repair the harm done to the victim and the community by an offender's criminal act. Ex: community service, Big Brother program indefinite sentence
12	Tutorial: Introduction to restorative justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behavior. It is best achieved through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. It can lead to the transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative goals will respond to crime by: 1 identifying and taking action to repair the harm, 2 involving all stakeholders, and. 3 Transform the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in response to crime.
13	Organize volunteer community panels, councils or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and the offender's obligation to repair the harm done to victims and community members. Facilitate the apology process to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim awareness training for probation staff.
14	The purpose of this article is to highlight a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then review the growing body of empirical evidence on victim-offender mediation. .
15	Each of these community types - the geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; community of care; and civil society - may be harmed by crime in different ways and to different degrees, but all will also be affected in common ways: their members' sense of security and trust is threatened, order within the community is threatened and (depending on the type of crime) shared community values ​​are challenged and perhaps eroded.
16	The approach is based on a theory of justice that views crime and wrongdoing as an offense against an individual or community, rather than against the state. Restorative justice that promotes dialogue between the victim and the perpetrator showed the highest rates of victim satisfaction and perpetrator empowerment.
17	The existence of a dispute between identifiable parties is inherent in many people's understanding of the concept of ADR. Criminal justice, however, is generally not conceptualized as a dispute between victim and offender, but rather as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offense can be properly described as a “dispute”.

19	The circle includes a wide range of participants, including not only the offender and the victim, but also friends and families, community members and representatives of the justice system. The main distinction between conferencing and circles is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the aggressor.
20	The phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. The phloem transports the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. … The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
21	Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that transport food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to provide efficient transport of food, nutrients, minerals and water.
22	Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that transport food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles.
23	The phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. The phloem transports the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
24	Unlike xylem (which is composed mostly of dead cells), phloem is composed of still-living cells that carry sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars brought by the photosynthetic zones.
25	In xylem vessels, water moves by massive flow rather than by cellular diffusion. In the phloem, the concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., a leaf) creates a diffusion gradient through which water flows into cells and phloem sap moves from the source of sugar organic substance sinks by turgor pressure.
26	The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem from sources to sinks is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), the sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) by active transport.
27	The phloem transports the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. … The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
28	Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. The phloem transfers sugars produced by the photosynthetic zones of plants to storage organs such as roots, tubers or bulbs.
29	At that time, the Industrial Workers of the World had over 100,000 members. In 1913, William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. At that time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
30	This was not the case with the Industrial Workers of the World and therefore many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
31	Chinese Immigration and Chinese Exclusion Laws. In the 1850s, Chinese workers emigrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take up agricultural jobs and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
32	The rise of industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late 19th century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and glare with inner corruption and poverty.
33	American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese workers who came to the United States did so to send money to China to support their families.
34	The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
35	The resulting Angell Treaty allowed the United States to restrict, but not completely ban, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which under the terms of the Angell Treaty suspended the immigration of Chinese workers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
36	Industrial workers of the world. In 1905, representatives of 43 groups that opposed the policies of the American Federation of Labor formed the radical labor organization, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The objective of the IWW was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the upper class.
37	Railroads fueled the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of the iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. Until 1882, steel rails accounted for 90% of steel production in the United States. They were the largest consumer of wood in the country and a heavy consumer of coal.
38	This ultimately resulted in legislation aimed at limiting future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States and threatening to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

49	Color - urine can be different colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very dark or amber. Unusual or abnormal urine colors can be the result of a disease process, several medications (for example, multivitamins can make urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.
50	I drank 3 cups of coffee and a red bull today in 4 hours. The first time I peed it was an amber color. Then I got worried and drank lots of water and now my urine is back to normal (light yellow). It only happened once after drinking all that caffeine. Related Topics: Coffee, Urination, Drinking, Caffeine.
51	During visual examination of urine, the laboratory worker observes the color and clarity of the urine. These can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine. They are interpreted together with the results obtained during chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm which substances are present.
52	But the basic details of your urine — color, smell, and frequency of urination — can give you a clue as to what's going on inside your body. Pee is your body's liquid waste product, mostly water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys do this when they filter toxins and other bad stuff from your blood.
53	However, red colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish urine which may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
54	The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it has no color, it may be because you drank a lot of water or took a medicine called a diuretic, which helps your body eliminate fluids. Very dark honey-colored or brown urine can be a sign that you are dehydrated and need more fluids right away.
55	As a general rule, the darker your urine, the more water you should drink. And if your urine is another color in addition to a varying shade of yellow (which we'll cover below), there may be something wrong.
56	Color, density and odor can reveal health issues. Human urine has been a useful diagnostic tool since the earliest days of medicine. The color, density and smell of urine can tell a lot about the state of our health. Here, to start, are some of the things you can tell from the color of your liquid feces. Advertising policy.
57	More concentrated urine in the bladder may be darker. As long as your urine has returned to a more normal light yellow color after drinking more water, there is no need to worry.

59	The most common cause of liver transplantation in adults is cirrhosis caused by various types of liver damage such as infections (hepatitis B and C), alcohol, autoimmune liver disease, liver cancer an early stage, metabolic and hereditary disorders, but also diseases of unknown etiology. Combination therapy of ursodeoxycholic acid and corticosteroids for primary biliary cirrhosis with features of autoimmune hepatitis: a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis was performed on RCTs comparing combination therapies of UDCA and corticosteroids with UDCA monotherapy.
60	Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis can produce life-threatening cholestatic liver disease (usually presenting in infancy) and progressive neurological disease presenting later in childhood or adulthood. The neurological presentation often includes signs of upper motor neuron damage (spastic paraparesis). The most useful screening test for many of these disorders is analysis of urine cholanoids (bile acids and bile alcohols); this is usually done now by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
61	Autoimmune liver disease and thyroid disease. Autoimmune disorders, including autoimmune thyroid disorders, occur in up to 34% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The presence of these disorders is associated with female gender, advanced age, and certain human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The liver can also be affected in patients with the genetic autoimmune disease, polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, which affects the thyroid gland. This interaction again demonstrates a crosstalk between the autoimmune disturbances of the thyroid system and the liver.
62	Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a chronic or long-term liver disease that slowly destroys the medium-sized bile ducts in the liver. Bile is a digestive fluid that is made in the liver. It travels through the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fatty fats and vitamins. In patients with PBC, the bile ducts are destroyed by inflammation. This causes bile to remain in the liver, where progressive injury damages liver cells and causes cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. As cirrhosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases, the liver loses its ability to function. from the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fatty fats and vitamins. In patients with PBC, the bile ducts are destroyed by inflammation. This causes bile to remain in the liver, where progressive injury damages liver cells and causes cirrhosis or scarring of the liver.
63	Hepatitis B and C, alcoholism, hemochromatosis and primary biliary cirrhosis - all causes of cirrhosis - are some of the main risk factors for liver cancer. Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Primary biliary cirrhosis. Up to 95% of cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) occur in women, usually around age 50. In people with PBC, the immune system attacks and destroys cells in the bile ducts of the liver. Like many autoimmune diseases, the causes of PBC are unknown.
64	Disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisome β-oxidation that affect bile acid synthesis will be discussed in the review by Ferdinandusse et al. The neurological presentation often includes signs of upper motor neuron damage (spastic paraparesis).

67	1 itching (pruritus). 2 Pruritus is the primary symptom of cholestasis and is thought to be due to interactions of serum bile acids with opioid nerves. 3 In fact, naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is used to treat pruritus due to cholestasis. It is secreted by the liver to aid in the digestion of fats. The formation of bile begins in the bile canaliculi which form between two adjacent surfaces of liver cells (hepatocytes) similar to the terminal branches of a tree.

69	However, one of the main motives of people today who want to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, often even before the end of the year. winter. This is actually the opposite of what the Talmud reports that Sanhedrin leaders occasionally do...
70	Some people argue that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year in determining the observance of the annual Feasts and Holy Days of God.
71	Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal. It was one of the first cultivated cereals and is now widely cultivated. Barley grain is a staple of Tibetan cuisine and was widely eaten by peasants in medieval Europe. Barley has also been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and some distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
72	The condition of the barley crop MAY BE able to delay the start of a year to THE NEXT NEW MOON (thus giving the previous year a 13th month), but the condition of the barley crop could not NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
73	The grape harvest was usually over before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came after the fall festivals. In ancient Israel, the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period can be subdivided into three seasons and three main crops: the spring cereal harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
74	Barley is not as cold tolerant as winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã—Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but can be sown as a winter crop in warmer parts of Australia and Britain. Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
75	"Wheat ripens later than barley and, according to Gezer's manual, was harvested in the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (late April to late May)" (page 88; see also table on page 37 of Borowski's book, reproduced below).
76	This statement is obviously not correct. God did not make the start of a new year dependent on the state of the barley crop, although on some occasions during the first and second centuries of our era the Pharisee leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley crop to start a new year a new moon later.
77	Barley is always sown in the fall, after the first rains, and the barley harvest, which for a given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho in April-- or even March--but in the highlands of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or the beginning of June.
78	Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain offerings and bread offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called "the feast of harvest" (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were sown in the fall and ripened in the spring. Barley ripened faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered at the Feast of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
79	There are, however, very serious conditions that can cause this pain on the left side under the ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and abdominal aortic dissection. It can also be a disorder of the spleen, kidney stones or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart sac).
80	Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the pain on the left side under the ribs is caused by an abdominal aortic dissection, your life is in immediate danger. Dying of internal bleeding is the major risk associated with this situation.
81	What organs are on your left side of the body. Causes of pain under the left rib cage. Here are some of the possible reasons why you are feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas stuck in your colon – You may have gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas blocked may be excessive.
82	For the individual bones, see Rib. For animal ribs as food, see Ribs (food). For other uses, see Rib (disambiguation). The ribcage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the spine, ribs and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs.
83	If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage are damaged due to an injury, it is likely that one will feel a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain gets worse when trying to bend or twist the body, an x-ray should be done to investigate the extent of damage to the ribs.
84	Vital organs such as the heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Below the rib cage are many organs that are part of the abdomen. Most of the organs found in the abdominal region are part of the digestive system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.
85	The only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one of the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart is also here. The only other part of the chest cavity worth noting would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this helpful.
86	Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper left side of your abdomen to the left side of your rib cage. Spleen irritation – It is possible that your spleen has already ruptured for various reasons, which can cause pain in your left rib cage.
87	Each rib consists of a head, neck, and shank, and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head of the rib is the terminal part closest to the vertebral column with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface divided by a horizontal crest into two facets.
88	With either of these, there is a fairly simple drug treatment. Gas may also be trapped in the colon. It's even less serious than acid reflux and doesn't require medication to fix it. Sharp pain on the left side under the ribs may be from a condition called costochondritis.
